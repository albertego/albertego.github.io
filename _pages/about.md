Walk away. That's right.

You know why I didn't take the job? Because it's too small! I don't care about it! It's nothing to me! It's a bacterium! I travel in worlds you can't even imagine! You can't conceive of what I'm capable of! I'm so far beyond you!

I'm like a god in human clothing! Lighting bolts shoot from my fingertips!
